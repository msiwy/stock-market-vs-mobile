The device offers a 7.9-inch Retina Display with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels. Processing power is provided by an Apple-designed A7 system-on-chip, and up to 128GB of storage are available for storing files and media. In charge is the latest version of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. All this is housed in a lightweight, 7.5-millimeter thin body made of premium aluminium. Unlike its predecessor, the iPad mini 3 has a Touch ID fingerprint scanner built into its home button.",

It lets you unlock the phone and authorize purchases, safely storing your fingerprints in the A7 processor itself, out of the reach for anyone but a few default iOS 7 apps.\n\nThis A7 processor debuts on the iPhone 5s as the first 64-bit mobile chipset in use on a commercial device, utilized by the latest flat and minimalistic iOS 7 that has been rewritten to take advantage of the 64-bit system. It sports a dedicated M7 co-processor for always-on motion sensing, too.\n\nThe iSight camera stayed 8 MP, but is much improved, with larger pixels, wider aperture, and the ability to shoot slow motion videos, not to mention the dual two-tone LED flash on the back that strives for natural skin color representation.",

        "description": "The iPhone 6 represents Apple's second largest departure in terms of design since the iPhone 4, and ushers in an era of rounded aesthetics. Equipped with a 4.7-inch display, the iPhone 6 is also much larger than its predecessor, the iPhone 5s, but Apple has managed to trim some extra fat in order to make the new iPhone even thinner, at 0.27 in (6.9 mm). \n\nThe innards of the iPhone 6, too, went through improvements. The home-grown dual-core A8 processor is the third consecutive Apple chip to be custom-designed, and offers performance improvements of up to 25% and 50% in the of CPU and GPU departments respectively. The 8-megapixel, 1/3” iSight camera also received several upgrades, mostly on the software side, and now offers faster, phase detection auto focus, plus support for super-smooth 720p clips at the industry-leading 240 frames per second.",
