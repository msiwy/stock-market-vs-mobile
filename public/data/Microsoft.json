That's right, Microsoft is keeping Windows RT around, and so the Surface 2 will be powered by the updated Windows RT 8.1 OS.\n\nRather than treating us to some kind of a complete redesign, Microsoft is keeping all the good stuff about the Surface RT and has upgraded the device where necessary. With a slightly thinner and lighter design, the Surface 2 will also sport a much better 10.6\" screen, upping the resolution from 1366 x 768 pixels to 1920 x 1080 pixels - a much-needed improvement. Under the hood, the Surface 2 will be powered by the new Tegra 4 chipset (the Surface RT had Tegra 3). Unfortunately, Tegra 4 hasn't seen much spotlight as far as smartphones are concerned, but it's slowly and steadily grabbing chunks of market share when it comes to tablets.\n\nA nice extra that Microsoft is going to bundle with the Surface 2 is called \"Best of Skype\". Basically, new Surface 2 owners will gain access to one year of free Skype Wi-Fi hotspots, as well as one year of free international Skype calls. What's more, users will also get 200 GB of free Skydrive storage.",
