The device offers a 7.9-inch Retina Display with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels. Processing power is provided by an Apple-designed A7 system-on-chip, and up to 128GB of storage are available for storing files and media. In charge is the latest version of iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. All this is housed in a lightweight, 7.5-millimeter thin body made of premium aluminium. Unlike its predecessor, the iPad mini 3 has a Touch ID fingerprint scanner built into its home button.",

Although the third-generation iPad remains the same on the outside (not a bad thing), it does bring a lot of improvements on the inside. First of all, it has a new screen resolution of 2048x1536 pixels, delivering an amazing for a tablet pixel density of 264 ppi. Another major improvement has to do with the processor of the device, which is now the so-called A5X - still a dual-core processor, but with a new quad-core GPU for outstanding graphics performance. The camera has also been given a boost and is now much more capable in terms of both photo- and video-taking. Finally, the new iPad 3 has been blessed with LTE connectivity. Additionally, all 4G iPads will also have global 3G capabilities, so you should be able to use 3G on most carriers around the world.",

Of course, there isn't exactly all that much that is new about the device, as it shares quite a bit in common with last year's Moto G. The major difference this year is in the design of the device, while the internals are only a modest update overall compared to last year's Moto G. On the outside, the changes can be summed up in two points: the display is now 5-inches rather than 4.5, and there are stereo front speakers. That's about it. On the inside, the cameras have gotten modest updates (8-megapixels in the rear and 2-megapixels in the front compared to 5MP and 1.3MP), and there is now a microSD card slot. Otherwise, the device has the same Snapdragon 400, 1GB of RAM, swappable shells, and software offerings.",

Colors retain their consistency and distortion has been eliminated.

Blackberry is yet to shed light on whether we're talking about a dual-core or quad-core, though the less potent version seems likely. In terms of memory, you'll find 2GB RAM, with just 16GB of internal storage, though you can expand that via a microSD card. BlackBerry claims that the battery on the Z30, at 2880mAh, coupled with software optimizations, offers 50% more battery life than its current competitors, though manufactures have a pretty shady track record when it comes to this particular bit of hardware, and its actual capabilities.\nTurning to the camera on the Z30, an increasingly relevant component of the entire package a smartphone offers lately, we're welcomed by a 8MP rear camera with Auto Focus, 5x digital zoom and a an LED flash. The large five element lens with an aperture of f/2.2 mean that the unit will capture a lot of light, resulting in great shots. The snapper, as is to be expected, is capable of 1080p video capture, and comes with what BB chose to call ‚ÄúTime Shift‚Äù ‚Äì a feature that basically allows you to choose and adjust faces from several snaps, so say goodbye to ill-timed shots.\nIn terms of connectivity and extras, the Z30 is anything but lacking ‚Äì you get GPS, 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi, of course, but also Bluetooth 4.0 LE (low energy), NFC, and the rather nice perk that is a microHDMI port.",

The Lumia 640 has all the options you'd expect from an affordable phone: more specifically, it arrives in a single- and dual-SIM versions with both a 3G model and 4G LTE version of the handset, including a dual-SIM LTE device. The handset comes in a range of colors including cyan, orange, black and white. It's also got an 8-megapixel camera with dynamic flash and auto HDR, as well as a front-facing camera with wide-angle lens. It is pre-loaded with the latest Lumia camera app update.",

    "description": "The Microsoft Lumia 430 has \"low-end\" written all over it. The smartphone packs a 4-inch display with 480 by 800 pixels of resolution, a dual-core Snapdragon 200 SoC running at up to 1.2GHz, 1GB of RAM, and 8GB of expandable storage. The main, fixed-focus camera has just 2MP of resolution, while the front-facing cam shoots 640 by 480-pixel images. The dual SIM functionality is welcome as it enables one to use two carriers' services on one device. All in all, a modest hardware configuration, but actually decent given the phone's price point. Windows Phone is known for running well even on low-end devices, and the 1GB of RAM should suffice for all the apps available on the Windows Phone Marketplace.Speaking of software, the Microsoft Lumia 430 ships with Windows Phone 8.1 along with the Denim update.",

    "description": "Microsoft Surface 2 is a new tablet that comes to succeed last year's Surface RT. That's right, Microsoft is keeping Windows RT around, and so the Surface 2 will be powered by the updated Windows RT 8.1 OS.\n\nRather than treating us to some kind of a complete redesign, Microsoft is keeping all the good stuff about the Surface RT and has upgraded the device where necessary. With a slightly thinner and lighter design, the Surface 2 will also sport a much better 10.6\" screen, upping the resolution from 1366 x 768 pixels to 1920 x 1080 pixels - a much-needed improvement. Under the hood, the Surface 2 will be powered by the new Tegra 4 chipset (the Surface RT had Tegra 3). Unfortunately, Tegra 4 hasn't seen much spotlight as far as smartphones are concerned, but it's slowly and steadily grabbing chunks of market share when it comes to tablets.\n\nA nice extra that Microsoft is going to bundle with the Surface 2 is called \"Best of Skype\". Basically, new Surface 2 owners will gain access to one year of free Skype Wi-Fi hotspots, as well as one year of free international Skype calls. What's more, users will also get 200 GB of free Skydrive storage.",
