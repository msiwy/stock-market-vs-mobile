That is the same chip powering the HTC One and expected to be in some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S IV. Judging from the similar model number (the Xperia Z is C660X), the upcoming Xperia C670X might end up looking similar save for the slightly smaller display. On the inside, it’s noticeably more muscular, though. The quad-core processor clock is bumped up to 1.8GHz, and it features Adreno 320 graphics. The C670X is also said to come with 2GB RAM, 32GB internal storage and a 13MP Exmor RS camera.",

Then again, the Xperia Tablet Z was so complete that it didn't leave that much room for improvement over a year. This isn't to say it didn't have any weak spots. For example, the Xpera Tablet Z2's 10.1-inch display has been reworked for the better. It offers better color reproduction and viewing angles compared to the Xperia Tablet Z1. Colors retain their consistency and distortion has been eliminated. On top of that, the Xpera Tablet Z2 manages to shave off some weight and thickness, while growing some additional muscle with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 801 CPU and 3GB of RAM.  Everything else is largely the same. The design, the 6000mAh battery and the 2.2MP front/8MP rear cameras have all been preserved from last year. Although not innovative, the Xperia Tablet Z2 is durable, slick, and a great high-end slate overall.",

The long-rumored IR blaster is indeed here, with the accompanying app that allows you to use the phone as a remote control for a wide variety of TVs, home stereos and other assorted electronics around the house.",

Then again, the Xperia Tablet Z was so complete that it didn't leave that much room for improvement over a year. This isn't to say it didn't have any weak spots. For example, the Xpera Tablet Z2's 10.1-inch display has been reworked for the better. It offers better color reproduction and viewing angles compared to the Xperia Tablet Z1. Colors retain their consistency and distortion has been eliminated. On top of that, the Xpera Tablet Z2 manages to shave off some weight and thickness, while growing some additional muscle with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 801 CPU and 3GB of RAM.  Everything else is largely the same. The design, the 6000mAh battery and the 2.2MP front/8MP rear cameras have all been preserved from last year. Although not innovative, the Xperia Tablet Z2 is durable, slick, and a great high-end slate overall.",

The funky part here is not only the circular power/lock key on the right, but also the front-facing camera, which is situated in the lower right corner of the phone, where you are used to find one of the Android navigational keys, which here are on-screen.\nBesides the shape and size, there is a slight difference in battery capacity between the two - the ZL has a sealed 2,370 mAh unit, which is a tad bigger than the one in the Z. The long-rumored IR blaster is indeed here, with the accompanying app that allows you to use the phone as a remote control for a wide variety of TVs, home stereos and other assorted electronics around the house.",

        "description": "Sony Xperia E dual is an affordable and compact dual SIM handset. The stand-out feature Sony wants us to note in the Xperia E is HD Voice, the purpose of which is to noticeably boost the sound quality of phone calls. When it comes to specs, the Xperia E will deliver a mid-range experience with its 3.5\" HVGA touchscreen and 1GHz processor. Let's hope that Jelly Bean's Project Butter will help get rid of the lag. Sony also claims that we'll be surprised by the battery life of the device. The 1500 mAh battery will benefit from a special extended stand-by mode designed to increase overall battery life. Basically, when the phone's sleeping, it will disable all functions except for calling and messaging, and once you wake it up, all functions will be restored to their normal state. Of course, users will be able to enjoy Sony's \"Walkman\" music experience, as well as the xLOUD sound technology, which works really well in most Sony smartphones.",

        "description": "The Sony Xperia T3 has IPS-LCD Triluminos screen with 720x1280 pixels resolution. The processing power is a bit on the slow side for today's standards, as the phone gets powered by a 1.4 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor, but this is the new midrange now, and it looks pretty svelte with the 150.7 x 77 x 7 mm chassis, built around a stainless steel frame. The memory situation includes 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of internal storage, and a microSD slot that takes up to 32 GB cards. There is an 8 MP Exmor RS sensor on the back for snapping and 1080p video purposes, and a 1.1 MP front-facing camera that does 720p recordings. Power is provided by a 2500 mAh battery. Naturally, Android 4.4 KitKat with Sony's own Xperia UI are loaded on the handset, too.",
